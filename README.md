# SA-MP-foreach
foreach standalone include (non y_iterate version)

Y_Less apparently left SA-MP again. Days before he dropped support for this version of foreach.

This version of foreach is 17. (0.4.1). This is the standalone version, so it does not require YSI.

The include is a bit cluttered, I am going to clean it up while keeping same usage.
